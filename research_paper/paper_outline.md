# Log Analyzer: A Versatile Framework for Multi-Format Log Analysis in Cybersecurity Applications

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel log analysis framework designed for cybersecurity applications that addresses the challenges of analyzing heterogeneous log formats from diverse sources. The framework supports multiple log formats including plain text, structured (JSON, XML, CSV), binary, syslog, Common Log Format (CLF), and Extended Log Format (ELF). It also provides capabilities for remote log acquisition via various protocols (SSH, HTTP, FTP) and offers advanced visualization techniques for security pattern recognition. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through several case studies and performance evaluations, showing significant improvements in analysis efficiency and threat detection capabilities compared to existing solutions.
